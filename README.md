# Invariant-mass-project
This Python program is my first particle physics data analysis project, in collaboration with Professor Whiteson of UC Irvine. This repository hosts the initial version of the "warmup" project that I am working on, as a prerequisite for a particle physics research project that I may complete in the future.
